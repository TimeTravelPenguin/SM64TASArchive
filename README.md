# SM64 TAS Archive
This repository serves to archive the critical milestones throughout SM64 TASing history. This repository stores TAS WR files for ILs, ABC, and full category runs.

## About this repository
Anyone is free to use this repository. If you have an improved TAS, wish to add a TAS currently not archived, etc., you can make a pull request. Alternatively, you can join the [Super Mario 64 TASing and ABC](https://discord.gg/ECskvyF) Discord server and contact me, TimeTravelPenguin.

## How to contribute?
If you have files you wish to contribute, you can either contact me or merge them yourself. To do so, fork this branch - this will create a clone of the repository - add those changes to your forked branch, then return here and select `New Pull Request`. Then choose this repository's master branch as the base, and your forked repo as the head. Then merge! Make sure you comment on your changes when you commit! It helps a lot to ensure correct mergers. Thanks!

## Repository structure
As this repository grows, the structure and layout surely will, also. For now, it will be as follows:
```
Root
 - ABC
 - Full Category
 - IL
```
From there, each directory should contain a collection of folders, each representing the data provided.
For IL related files, the address should look like `~/IL/BoB/Behind-Chain-Chomps-Gate/{TAS time}`.
Or, further succinctly, as `~/IL/{Level}/{Star}/{TAS time}`.

For full category related files, it should be stored as `~/Full-Category/{Category}/{TAS Time}`.
`{TAS time}` should be in `#m#s#ms` notation. For example, a TAS of 201.5 seconds should be `3m21s50ms`, rounding the ms to 2d.p.

## Why make this repository?
Tool-assisted speedrunning has been a big part of my life. Newcomers and non-TASers deserve equal access to resources as any other member of the community. However, without understanding the community's structure, accessing TASing information is almost impossible in many cases. So, I have made it my mission to build this library as a way of allowing an easy-access means of locating the verified resources.
